I doubt you will find anyone outside the scientific comunity who is as well Read on the subject of common decent / Evolution.

As to the evidence , the facts exist the conclusion is wrong. Yes each form of life was created by kind and has a built in ability to change as needed but stops short of becoming anything outside that animal family. 14 species and countless subspecies but all by design. 

Yes I understand genetics, and the thin amount of fossils claimed to be transitional. Do you know anything about complex proteins required for life? 2000 all left hand required at the same time in a oxidizing enviroment? The odds trump the theory.  As a trump she could have triggered at an Endbringer event or some other large fight. Collecting the shards of a few dying capes would be easy. a couple things to note on trump.  he said his playstle for the paladin deck was mostly focused on "best case scenarios" in regards to the quartermaster.  that "it could be good" and also noting that it isnt necessarily correct to think that.  also,  when someone asked him to take out harrison,  he said there were lots of weapon classes being played ATM and harrison was a good card to keep in.   
when i stopped watching trump today (durign one of his deck evaluations) he said he hasnt played enough games yet to determine if its good or just bad,  and that he wasnt drawing particularly well. I don't doubt it, but the legality of controls via mail order is dubious and state law would trump whatever your insurance mandates. I'm not saying don't date at all, I'm saying having friendships should trump dating in terms of priorities.

Dating is a temporary form of socialization in, I'd say, at least 50% of cases, filled with many rejections. The vast majority of relations end after 1 date. Maybe OP wants something more than that, and I can't imagine it's easy when you're eager and desperate to communicate, especially if you are male. I've seen guys get depressed over no replies, no messages, no dates because it happens. I don't want OP to see this as a magical solution to their lack of knowing people. If he can build a wall on the Mexican border and make Mexico pay for it, he's a genius and deserves to be president even for this one thing. All this Trump hate but Hillary is running? Hillary is the devil in flesh form. &gt; Its very unlikely that that would be 'the end of it' if there was a sub-optimal outcome from the birth.

Patients express wishes against the doctors instructions trump it. She wouldn't have been able to sue, he wouldn't have committed a crime.

&gt;Keep in mind that the obstetrician has two patients - both the mother and the child, and that he/she must weight the pros and cons of any intervention with this in mind.

The mother's wishes come first, until she is incapacitated (she wasn't) at which point it falls to the person she appointed or her next of kin. At no point, would that decision have fallen to the doctor.

&gt;From a medico-legal standpoint, the mother may not have been in a position to give or deny consent, depending on what 'sedative' she was given. 

She was awake and aware and capable of articulating a clear and coherent question, which caused the doctor to feel that his authority was impugned and then he assaulted her, committing a felony. That's mens rea and actus rea.

Honestly, I don't see the issue here. A doctor is not allowed to simply attack patients and patients do not surrender all autonomy the moment they walk through the doors of a hospital. A medical degree does not confer immunity from the law. Suggesting so undoes decades of advancement in medical ethics.  Wouldn't that just give her a trump rating because it only interacts with parahumans (not PRT agents) It would be really interesting to see what would happen against telepaths with those three. I agree with you that these three would likely be overcome, barring Eidolon trump shenanigans, but considering that Alexandria might be immune to Simurgh's telepathy, I wonder how standard telepathy would work. Would she have some immunity due to her body's timelocked nature? Trolling history - the last refuge of scoundrels who can't be bothered to reply to what someone said. I created that sub in jest as a response to dozens complaints from posers that this sub should ban positive comments about having a big dick. No doubt, it's a trump card. Doesn't affect any of the points I made.  What's the date of the last post in that sub, by the way? ;)
